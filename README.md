## What I Learned
  - The biggest tool that I learned about on this project was the Switch statement in Javascript. I had initially thought that I would use a few if/else statements with the radio buttons, but a classmate said that I should look into this. It was very useful and saved a lot of time from having to go through all the different dishes.
  - A smaller, also very useful, trick was to put checked in one of the radio buttons by default. Part of the ruberic was to not allow a button to be selected and have nothing happen, so by defaulting a radio button to be selected, we are able to skip building a function for a window alert or similar notification that a button should be selected.
